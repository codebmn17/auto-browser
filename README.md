# Auto Browser

A visual Auto Browser control plane for LLM-driven workflows.

This scaffold gives you:
- a **browser node** with Chromium, Xvfb, x11vnc, and noVNC
- a **controller API** built on FastAPI + Playwright
- **screen-aware observations** with screenshots and interactable element IDs
- optional **OCR excerpts** from screenshots via Tesseract
- **human takeover** through noVNC
- **artifact capture** for screenshots, traces, and storage state
- optional **encrypted auth-state storage** with max-age enforcement on restore
- **basic policy rails** with host allowlists and upload approval gates
- **durable session metadata** under `/data/sessions`, with optional Redis backing
- **durable agent job records** under `/data/jobs` with background workers for queued step/run requests
- **audit events** with per-request operator identity headers
- optional **SQLite backing** for approvals + audit events
- provider adapters for **OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini** behind one internal action schema
- one-step and multi-step **agent orchestration endpoints**
- richer browser abilities through the shared action schema: **hover, select_option, wait, reload, back, forward**
- **tab awareness and tab controls** for popup-heavy workflows
- **download capture** with session-scoped files and URLs under `/artifacts`
- a browser-node managed **Playwright server endpoint** so the controller connects over Playwright protocol instead of CDP
- optional **docker-ephemeral per-session browser isolation** with dedicated noVNC ports
- a **real MCP JSON-RPC transport** at `/mcp`, plus convenience endpoints at `/mcp/tools` + `/mcp/tools/call`

It is intentionally **not** a stealth or anti-bot system. It is for operator-assisted browser workflows on sites and accounts you are authorized to use.

See:

- `docs/llm-adapters.md` for the model-facing action loop
- `docs/production-hardening.md` for the production target/spec
- `docs/deployment.md` for the deployment and credential handoff checklist

## Quickstart

```bash
cd auto-browser
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open:
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Visual takeover: `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale`

All published ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.

If you want the controller API itself protected, set `API_BEARER_TOKEN` and send:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Optional operator headers:

```bash
X-Operator-Id: alice
X-Operator-Name: Alice Example
```

Set `REQUIRE_OPERATOR_ID=true` if every non-health request must carry an operator ID.

### Production-mode minimums

For a real private beta, set at least:

```bash
APP_ENV=production
API_BEARER_TOKEN=<strong-random-secret>
REQUIRE_OPERATOR_ID=true
AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<44-char-fernet-key>
REQUIRE_AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION=true
REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
METRICS_ENABLED=true
```

The controller now fails closed on startup in production mode if the required security settings are missing.

### Provider auth modes

By default the controller talks to vendor APIs directly with API keys.

If you already use subscription-backed CLIs instead, Auto Browser can route provider decisions through:

- `codex` for OpenAI
- `claude` for Anthropic / Claude Code
- `gemini` for Gemini CLI

Set the auth modes explicitly:

```bash
OPENAI_AUTH_MODE=cli
CLAUDE_AUTH_MODE=cli
GEMINI_AUTH_MODE=cli
CLI_HOME=/data/cli-home
```

Then populate `data/cli-home` with the auth caches from the machine where those CLIs are already signed in:

```bash
mkdir -p data/cli-home
rsync -a ~/.codex data/cli-home/.codex
cp ~/.claude.json data/cli-home/.claude.json
rsync -a ~/.claude data/cli-home/.claude
rsync -a ~/.gemini data/cli-home/.gemini
```

If you just want to sign in interactively on this host, use the included bootstrap helper instead. It opens the CLI inside the controller image with `HOME=/data/cli-home`, so the login state lands exactly where Auto Browser expects it:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_cli_auth.sh codex
./scripts/bootstrap_cli_auth.sh claude
./scripts/bootstrap_cli_auth.sh gemini
# or
./scripts/bootstrap_cli_auth.sh all
```

If this box already has those subscription logins locally, the smoother path is to mount the real host homes read-only at their native paths instead of copying caches around:

```bash
CLI_HOST_HOME=/home/botuser \
OPENAI_AUTH_MODE=cli \
CLAUDE_AUTH_MODE=cli \
GEMINI_AUTH_MODE=cli \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host-subscriptions.yml up --build
```

That override:
- mounts `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `~/.claude.json`, and `~/.gemini` read-only
- sets `CLI_HOME` to the host-style home path inside the container
- behaves much more like running the CLIs directly on the host

If your host home is not `/home/botuser`, set `CLI_HOST_HOME` first.

If Codex subscription auth still does not survive inside Docker cleanly, use the host-side bridge instead. It runs `codex` on the host and exposes a Unix socket through the shared `./data` mount:

```bash
mkdir -p data/host-bridge
python3 scripts/codex_host_bridge.py --socket-path data/host-bridge/codex.sock
```

If you want it to behave more like a persistent host skill, install the included user-service template once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp ops/systemd/codex-host-bridge.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now codex-host-bridge.service
```

Then start the controller with:

```bash
OPENAI_AUTH_MODE=host_bridge \
OPENAI_HOST_BRIDGE_SOCKET=/data/host-bridge/codex.sock \
docker compose up --build
```

That gives OpenAI/Codex the closest behavior to a host-side skill, because the actual CLI stays on the host instead of inside the container.

Notes:
- the bridge socket is now health-checked, not just path-checked
- host codex requests are killed after 55s by default so the bridge does not leak orphaned CLI jobs
- the bridge is a **local trust boundary**: anyone who can talk to that Unix socket can make the host run `codex exec`
- keep `data/host-bridge` private to trusted local users/processes only
- keep `data/cli-home` private; it contains live auth material
- API keys are still the better default for CI/public automation
- CLI auth is aimed at trusted single-tenant boxes like your VPS + Tailscale setup

If you want **true per-session browser isolation**, use the compose override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.isolation.yml up --build
```

That keeps the default shared browser-node available, but new sessions are provisioned as one-off browser containers with their own noVNC ports when `SESSION_ISOLATION_MODE=docker_ephemeral`.
Raise `MAX_SESSIONS` above `1` if you want multiple isolated sessions live at once.
The existing reverse-SSH sidecar still only tunnels the controller API plus the shared browser-node noVNC port.
If isolated session noVNC ports are only bound locally, enable the controller-managed `ISOLATED_TUNNEL_*` settings to open a reverse-SSH tunnel per session.
If you already have direct host reachability, set `ISOLATED_TAKEOVER_HOST` to a host humans can actually reach and skip the extra tunnel broker.
When the controller brokers an isolated-session tunnel, it targets the per-session browser container over the Docker network by default instead of hairpinning back through a host-published port.

For remote access, you now have two sane paths:
- put the stack behind **Tailscale / Cloudflare Access**
- run the optional **reverse-SSH sidecar** and point `TAKEOVER_URL` at the forwarded noVNC URL

If `8000`, `6080`, or `5900` are already taken on the host, override them inline:

```bash
API_PORT=8010 NOVNC_PORT=6081 VNC_PORT=5901 \
TAKEOVER_URL='http://127.0.0.1:6081/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale' \
docker compose up --build
```

### Shared action schema and download API

Beyond the convenience routes (`/actions/click`, `/actions/type`, etc.), the controller now exposes:

- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/actions/execute`
  - accepts the full shared `BrowserActionDecision` schema
  - supports `hover`, `select_option`, `wait`, `reload`, `go_back`, and `go_forward`
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/tabs`
  - lists the currently open pages in the session
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/tabs/activate`
  - makes a tab the primary page for future observations/actions
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/tabs/close`
  - closes a tab by index and rebinds the session to the active tab
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/downloads`
  - lists files captured for that session
  - download files are saved under the session artifact tree and served from `/artifacts/...`

### Reverse SSH remote access

This repo now includes an optional `reverse-ssh` profile that forwards:
- controller API `8000` -> remote port `REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_API_PORT`
- noVNC `6080` -> remote port `REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_NOVNC_PORT`

Setup:

```bash
mkdir -p data/ssh data/tunnels
chmod 700 data/ssh
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 data/ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 600 data/ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-keyscan -p 22 bastion.example.com > data/ssh/known_hosts
```

Then set these in `.env`:

```bash
REVERSE_SSH_HOST=bastion.example.com
REVERSE_SSH_USER=browserbot
REVERSE_SSH_PORT=22
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_API_PORT=18000
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_NOVNC_PORT=16080
REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=private
TAKEOVER_URL=http://bastion.example.com:16080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale
```

Start it:

```bash
docker compose --profile reverse-ssh up --build
```

Notes:
- default remote bind is `127.0.0.1` on the SSH server. That is safer.
- the sidecar refuses non-local reverse binds unless `REVERSE_SSH_ALLOW_NONLOCAL_BIND=true`.
- `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=private` is the default. That means bastion-only unless you front it with Tailscale or Cloudflare Access.
- `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=cloudflare-access` expects `REVERSE_SSH_PUBLIC_SCHEME=https`.
- non-local reverse binds are only allowed in `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=unsafe-public`. That is intentionally loud because `GatewayPorts` exposure is easy to get wrong.
- the sidecar writes connection metadata to `data/tunnels/reverse-ssh.json`.
- the sidecar refreshes that metadata on a heartbeat, and the controller marks stale tunnel metadata as inactive.

### Run the local reverse-SSH smoke test

This repo includes a self-contained smoke harness with a disposable SSH bastion container:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_reverse_ssh.sh
```

If `8000` is busy on the host, run the smoke with an override like `API_PORT=8010 ./scripts/smoke_reverse_ssh.sh`.

It verifies:
- controller `/remote-access`
- forwarded API through the bastion
- forwarded noVNC through the bastion
- session create + observe through the forwarded API

### Run the local isolated-session smoke test

This repo also includes a smoke harness for per-session docker isolation:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_isolated_session.sh
```

If the default controller port is busy, run `API_PORT=8010 ./scripts/smoke_isolated_session.sh`.

It verifies:
- controller readiness with the isolation override enabled
- session create in `docker_ephemeral` mode
- dedicated per-session noVNC port wiring
- session-scoped `remote_access` metadata
- observe + close flow
- isolated browser container cleanup after close

### Run the local isolated-session tunnel smoke test

This repo also includes a smoke harness for controller-managed reverse tunnels on isolated session takeover ports:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_isolated_session_tunnel.sh
```

If the default controller port is busy, run `API_PORT=8010 ./scripts/smoke_isolated_session_tunnel.sh`.

It verifies:
- controller-managed isolated session tunnel provisioning against the disposable bastion
- session-specific remote-access payloads flipping to `active`
- remote noVNC reachability from the bastion on the assigned per-session port
- isolated tunnel teardown on session close

### Check configured model providers

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/providers | jq
```

Each provider entry reports:
- `configured`
- `auth_mode` (`api` or `cli`)
- `model`
- `detail` with the concrete readiness reason or missing prerequisite

### Inspect active remote-access metadata

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/remote-access | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/remote-access?session_id=<session-id>' | jq
```

If the reverse-SSH sidecar is running, observations and session summaries will automatically return the forwarded `takeover_url` from `data/tunnels/reverse-ssh.json`.
For isolated sessions, the `remote_access` payload becomes session-specific so you can see whether that session’s own noVNC URL is still local-only, directly reachable, or being served through a controller-managed session tunnel.

### Create a session

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"demo","start_url":"https://example.com"}' | jq
```

### Observe the page

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/observe | jq
```

The response includes:
- current URL and title
- a page-level `text_excerpt`
- a compact `dom_outline` with headings, forms, and element counts
- an `accessibility_outline` distilled from Playwright’s accessibility tree
- an `ocr` payload with screenshot text excerpts and bounding boxes
- a screenshot path and artifact URL
- interactable elements with observation-scoped `element_id` values
- recent console errors
- the effective noVNC takeover URL
- remote-access metadata when a tunnel sidecar is active
- explicit isolation metadata, including per-session auth/upload roots and the shared-browser-node limit

### Click by `element_id`

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/click \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"element_id":"op-abc123"}' | jq
```

### Type into an input

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/type \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"selector":"input[name=q]","text":"playwright mcp","clear_first":true}' | jq
```

### Save auth state for later reuse

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/storage-state \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"demo-auth.json"}' | jq
```

That path is now saved under the session’s own auth root:

```text
/data/auth/<session-id>/demo-auth.json
```

If `AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, the controller saves:

```text
/data/auth/<session-id>/demo-auth.json.enc
```

Restores enforce `AUTH_STATE_MAX_AGE_HOURS`, so stale auth-state files are rejected instead of silently reused.

Inspect the current auth-state metadata:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/auth-state | jq
```

### Stage upload files

This POC expects upload files to be staged on disk first:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/example.pdf data/uploads/
```

For cleaner isolation, you can also stage per-session files under:

```text
data/uploads/<session-id>/
```

Then request and execute approval through the queue:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/upload \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"selector":"input[type=file]","file_path":"example.pdf"}' | jq
```

That returns `409` with a pending approval payload. Then:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id>/approve \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"comment":"approved"}' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id>/execute \
  -X POST | jq
```

### Inspect approvals

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id> | jq
```

### Ask a provider for one next step

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/step \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"openai",
    "goal":"Open the main link on the page and stop.",
    "observation_limit":25
  }' | jq
```

### Let a provider run a short loop

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/run \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"claude",
    "goal":"Fill the search field with playwright mcp and stop before submitting.",
    "max_steps":4
  }' | jq
```

If a model proposes an upload, post/send, payment, account change, or destructive step, the run now stops with `status=approval_required` and writes a queued approval item instead of executing the side effect.

### Queue agent work for background execution

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/jobs/step \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"openai",
    "goal":"Inspect the page and stop."
  }' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/jobs/run \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"claude",
    "goal":"Open the first result and summarize it.",
    "max_steps":4
  }' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/jobs | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/jobs/<job-id> | jq
```

Queued jobs are persisted under `/data/jobs`. If the controller restarts mid-run, any previously `running` jobs are marked `interrupted` on startup instead of disappearing.

### Audit trail and operator identity

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/operator | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/audit/events?limit=20' | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/audit/events?session_id=<session-id>' | jq
```

Audit events are written to `/data/audit/events.jsonl`.

If `STATE_DB_PATH` is set, approvals and audit events are also stored in SQLite and served from there. `AUDIT_MAX_EVENTS` caps retained audit rows/events in both SQLite and the mirrored JSONL file.

### Metrics and cleanup

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics | head
curl -s http://localhost:8000/maintenance/status | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/maintenance/cleanup \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "X-Operator-Id: ops" | jq
```

The controller can now:
- expose Prometheus-style request/session metrics at `/metrics`
- prune stale artifacts, uploads, and auth-state files on startup and on a configurable interval

If `METRICS_ENABLED=false`, `/metrics` returns `404`.

### MCP browser gateway

Convenience endpoints still exist:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/tools | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/tools/call \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"browser.observe",
    "arguments":{"session_id":"<session-id>","limit":20}
  }' | jq
```

The controller now also exposes a real MCP-style JSON-RPC session transport at `/mcp`:

```bash
INIT=$(curl -si http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"initialize",
    "params":{
      "protocolVersion":"2025-11-25",
      "clientInfo":{"name":"demo-client","version":"0.1.0"},
      "capabilities":{}
    }
  }')

SESSION_ID=$(printf "%s" "$INIT" | awk -F": " '/^MCP-Session-Id:/ {print $2}' | tr -d '\r')

curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -X POST \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Session-Id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized","params":{}}'

curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -X POST \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Session-Id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | jq
```

Notes:
- this transport supports `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `DELETE /mcp` session teardown
- JSON-RPC batching is intentionally rejected
- if a browser client sends an `Origin` header, set `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact allowed origins

## Opinionated defaults

- Keep **Playwright** as the execution engine.
- Use **screenshots + DOM/interactable metadata** together.
- Use **noVNC/xpra-style takeover** when a flow gets brittle.
- Use **one session per account/workflow**.
- Never automate with your daily browser profile.
- Keep **one active session per browser node** in this POC because takeover is tied to one visible desktop.
- If you need parallel sessions, switch to `docker_ephemeral` isolation so each live session gets its own browser container and takeover port.
- Keep a durable session registry even in the POC so restarts downgrade active sessions to **interrupted** instead of losing them.
- Treat each session’s auth/upload roots as isolated working state even though the visible desktop is still shared.
- Encrypt auth-state at rest once you move beyond localhost demos.
- Require operator IDs once more than one human or worker touches the system.

## Production upgrades after the POC

- replace raw local ports with **Tailscale**, Cloudflare Access, or a hardened bastion
- move session metadata from file/Redis into a richer Postgres model if you need querying and joins
- promote the docker-ephemeral path into **one browser pod per account** once you want scheduler-level isolation
- persist approvals in a database instead of flat files when the POC grows
- add per-operator identity / SSO on top of the approval queue
- add SSE streaming on top of the current MCP JSON-RPC transport if you need server-pushed events
