# Browser Operator POC

A visual browser-operator proof of concept for LLM-driven workflows.

This scaffold gives you:
- a **browser node** with Chromium, Xvfb, x11vnc, and noVNC
- a **controller API** built on FastAPI + Playwright
- **screen-aware observations** with screenshots and interactable element IDs
- optional **OCR excerpts** from screenshots via Tesseract
- **human takeover** through noVNC
- **artifact capture** for screenshots, traces, and storage state
- optional **encrypted auth-state storage** with max-age enforcement on restore
- **basic policy rails** with host allowlists and upload approval gates
- **durable session metadata** under `/data/sessions`, with optional Redis backing
- **durable agent job records** under `/data/jobs` with background workers for queued step/run requests
- **audit events** with per-request operator identity headers
- provider adapters for **OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini** behind one internal action schema
- one-step and multi-step **agent orchestration endpoints**
- a browser-node managed **Playwright server endpoint** so the controller connects over Playwright protocol instead of CDP
- an **MCP-shaped browser tool gateway** at `/mcp/tools` + `/mcp/tools/call`

It is intentionally **not** a stealth or anti-bot system. It is for operator-assisted browser workflows on sites and accounts you are authorized to use.

```

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full design and `docs/llm-adapters.md` for the model-facing action loop.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd browser-operator-poc
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open:
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Visual takeover: `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale`

All published ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.

If you want the controller API itself protected, set `API_BEARER_TOKEN` and send:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Optional operator headers:

```bash
X-Operator-Id: alice
X-Operator-Name: Alice Example
```

Set `REQUIRE_OPERATOR_ID=true` if every non-health request must carry an operator ID.

For remote access, you now have two sane paths:
- put the stack behind **Tailscale / Cloudflare Access**
- run the optional **reverse-SSH sidecar** and point `TAKEOVER_URL` at the forwarded noVNC URL

If `8000`, `6080`, or `5900` are already taken on the host, override them inline:

```bash
API_PORT=8010 NOVNC_PORT=6081 VNC_PORT=5901 \
TAKEOVER_URL='http://127.0.0.1:6081/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale' \
docker compose up --build
```

### Reverse SSH remote access

This repo now includes an optional `reverse-ssh` profile that forwards:
- controller API `8000` -> remote port `REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_API_PORT`
- noVNC `6080` -> remote port `REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_NOVNC_PORT`

Setup:

```bash
mkdir -p data/ssh data/tunnels
chmod 700 data/ssh
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 data/ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 600 data/ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-keyscan -p 22 bastion.example.com > data/ssh/known_hosts
```

Then set these in `.env`:

```bash
REVERSE_SSH_HOST=bastion.example.com
REVERSE_SSH_USER=browserbot
REVERSE_SSH_PORT=22
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_API_PORT=18000
REVERSE_SSH_REMOTE_NOVNC_PORT=16080
REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=private
TAKEOVER_URL=http://bastion.example.com:16080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale
```

Start it:

```bash
docker compose --profile reverse-ssh up --build
```

Notes:
- default remote bind is `127.0.0.1` on the SSH server. That is safer.
- the sidecar refuses non-local reverse binds unless `REVERSE_SSH_ALLOW_NONLOCAL_BIND=true`.
- `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=private` is the default. That means bastion-only unless you front it with Tailscale or Cloudflare Access.
- `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=cloudflare-access` expects `REVERSE_SSH_PUBLIC_SCHEME=https`.
- non-local reverse binds are only allowed in `REVERSE_SSH_ACCESS_MODE=unsafe-public`. That is intentionally loud because `GatewayPorts` exposure is easy to get wrong.
- the sidecar writes connection metadata to `data/tunnels/reverse-ssh.json`.
- the sidecar refreshes that metadata on a heartbeat, and the controller marks stale tunnel metadata as inactive.

### Run the local reverse-SSH smoke test

This repo includes a self-contained smoke harness with a disposable SSH bastion container:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_reverse_ssh.sh
```

It verifies:
- controller `/remote-access`
- forwarded API through the bastion
- forwarded noVNC through the bastion
- session create + observe through the forwarded API

### Check configured model providers

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/providers | jq
```

### Inspect active remote-access metadata

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/remote-access | jq
```

If the reverse-SSH sidecar is running, observations and session summaries will automatically return the forwarded `takeover_url` from `data/tunnels/reverse-ssh.json`.

### Create a session

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"demo","start_url":"https://example.com"}' | jq
```

### Observe the page

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/observe | jq
```

The response includes:
- current URL and title
- a page-level `text_excerpt`
- a compact `dom_outline` with headings, forms, and element counts
- an `accessibility_outline` distilled from Playwright’s accessibility tree
- an `ocr` payload with screenshot text excerpts and bounding boxes
- a screenshot path and artifact URL
- interactable elements with observation-scoped `element_id` values
- recent console errors
- the effective noVNC takeover URL
- remote-access metadata when a tunnel sidecar is active
- explicit isolation metadata, including per-session auth/upload roots and the shared-browser-node limit

### Click by `element_id`

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/click \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"element_id":"op-abc123"}' | jq
```

### Type into an input

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/type \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"selector":"input[name=q]","text":"playwright mcp","clear_first":true}' | jq
```

### Save auth state for later reuse

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/storage-state \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"demo-auth.json"}' | jq
```

That path is now saved under the session’s own auth root:

```text
/data/auth/<session-id>/demo-auth.json
```

If `AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, the controller saves:

```text
/data/auth/<session-id>/demo-auth.json.enc
```

Restores enforce `AUTH_STATE_MAX_AGE_HOURS`, so stale auth-state files are rejected instead of silently reused.

Inspect the current auth-state metadata:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/auth-state | jq
```

### Stage upload files

This POC expects upload files to be staged on disk first:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/example.pdf data/uploads/
```

For cleaner isolation, you can also stage per-session files under:

```text
data/uploads/<session-id>/
```

Then request and execute approval through the queue:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/actions/upload \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"selector":"input[type=file]","file_path":"example.pdf"}' | jq
```

That returns `409` with a pending approval payload. Then:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id>/approve \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"comment":"approved"}' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id>/execute \
  -X POST | jq
```

### Inspect approvals

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8000/approvals/<approval-id> | jq
```

### Ask a provider for one next step

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/step \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"openai",
    "goal":"Open the main link on the page and stop.",
    "observation_limit":25
  }' | jq
```

### Let a provider run a short loop

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/run \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"claude",
    "goal":"Fill the search field with playwright mcp and stop before submitting.",
    "max_steps":4
  }' | jq
```

If a model proposes an upload, post/send, payment, account change, or destructive step, the run now stops with `status=approval_required` and writes a queued approval item instead of executing the side effect.

### Queue agent work for background execution

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/jobs/step \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"openai",
    "goal":"Inspect the page and stop."
  }' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/sessions/<session-id>/agent/jobs/run \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "provider":"claude",
    "goal":"Open the first result and summarize it.",
    "max_steps":4
  }' | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/jobs | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8000/agent/jobs/<job-id> | jq
```

Queued jobs are persisted under `/data/jobs`. If the controller restarts mid-run, any previously `running` jobs are marked `interrupted` on startup instead of disappearing.

### Audit trail and operator identity

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/operator | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/audit/events?limit=20' | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/audit/events?session_id=<session-id>' | jq
```

Audit events are written to `/data/audit/events.jsonl`.

### MCP-shaped browser gateway

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/tools | jq

curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/tools/call \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"browser.observe",
    "arguments":{"session_id":"<session-id>","limit":20}
  }' | jq
```

This is not a full MCP transport server yet. It is a clean MCP-shaped HTTP surface that other agents can reuse now.

## Opinionated defaults

- Keep **Playwright** as the execution engine.
- Use **screenshots + DOM/interactable metadata** together.
- Use **noVNC/xpra-style takeover** when a flow gets brittle.
- Use **one session per account/workflow**.
- Never automate with your daily browser profile.
- Keep **one active session per browser node** in this POC because takeover is tied to one visible desktop.
- Keep a durable session registry even in the POC so restarts downgrade active sessions to **interrupted** instead of losing them.
- Treat each session’s auth/upload roots as isolated working state even though the visible desktop is still shared.
- Encrypt auth-state at rest once you move beyond localhost demos.
- Require operator IDs once more than one human or worker touches the system.

## Production upgrades after the POC

- replace raw local ports with **Tailscale**, Cloudflare Access, or a hardened bastion
- move session metadata from file/Redis into a richer Postgres model if you need querying and joins
- run **one browser pod per account**
- persist approvals in a database instead of flat files when the POC grows
- add per-operator identity / SSO on top of the approval queue
- turn the MCP-shaped gateway into a full MCP transport if you need native tool discovery/streaming
